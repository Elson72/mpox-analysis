### Introduction

Mpox (previously known as monkeypox) is a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus called monkeypox virus. It spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, causing a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. It can make people very sick and leave scar.

### Project Overview

This report presents an analysis of mpox (monkeypox) data in Africa, utilizing a comprehensive dataset sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) directory. The data spans from January 2022 to September 2024, providing a timely overview of the disease's progression across the continent. Our analysis aims to uncover key insights regarding trends in mpox infections, demographic impacts, and regional variations, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the current epidemiological landscape and informing public health strategies.  

### Tools

- Python - Data cleaning and Exploratory data analysis
- MS PowerBI - Creating dashboards


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the mpox africa dataset to answer key questions, such as:
1. Trend of confirmed cases for each country over the last 3years?
2. Trend of confirmed deaths for each country over the last 3 years?
3. What is the Case Fatality Ratio?


### Conclusions/Summary

In our comprehensive analysis of mpox cases in Africa from January 1, 2022, to September 1, 2023, we observed a total of 6,154 confirmed cases and 54 deaths attributed to the disease. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reported the highest incidence, with approximately 4,500 cases, followed by Nigeria with nearly 1,000 cases. The DRC also recorded the most fatalities, totaling 27 deaths, while Nigeria accounted for 9 deaths, and Cameroon had a significant toll as well.

It is evident that Central Africa has been disproportionately affected by mpox, particularly countries such as the DRC, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and Congo. In addition, West Africa is emerging as a notable area of concern, with Nigeria, Ghana, and Liberia showing significant case numbers and fatalities. The analysis highlighted that the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) was highest in Cameroon, indicating a critical need for focused public health interventions.

Reviewing the data specifically from 2022, we noted a total of 1,248 cases and 15 deaths, with Nigeria (756 cases) and Ghana (121 cases) leading in caseloads, while the DRC and the Central African Republic reported comparatively lower figures. Notably, Nigeria and Ghana also reported the highest death tolls in 2022.

This data suggests an initial concentration of cases and fatalities in West Africa early in the progression of the disease, contrasted with a significant rise in cases and deaths in Central Africa in subsequent years.

### Limitations
- Lack of availability of clinical dataset which would typically  provide valuable information about patient demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, prognosis and  treatment outcomes.
- Without clinical data, it is difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatments or interventions on patient outcomes, which is essential for improving patient care and developing guidelines.
- Clinical datasets can help identify patterns in disease transmission, including populations at higher risk. Without this information, it becomes challenging to implement effective public health strategies or targeted interventions.


### Recommendations
1. Implement continuous monitoring to promptly identify and respond to new cases, particularly in high-risk areas identified in this analysis.
2. Foster partnerships among affected countries to share data, resources, and best practices for mpox prevention and treatment.
3. Develop targeted awareness campaigns in the most affected regions, educating populations about the disease, its transmission, and prevention strategies.
4. Conduct studies to investigate the factors contributing to regional differences in case severity and mortality, aiming to understand the epidemiology of mpox better.
5. Ensure equitable distribution of medical resources, including vaccines and treatments, particularly in countries with higher rates of infections and fatalities.
