# Mpox Africa Analysis
 
### Introduction

Mpox (previously known as monkeypox) is a viral disease caused by an orthopoxvirus called monkeypox virus. It spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has mpox, causing a painful rash, enlarged lymph nodes and fever. It can make people very sick and leave scar.

### Project Overview

This report presents an analysis of mpox (monkeypox) data in Africa, utilizing a comprehensive dataset sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) directory. The data spans from January 2022 to September 2024, providing a timely overview of the disease's progression across the continent. Our analysis aims to uncover key insights regarding trends in mpox infections, demographic impacts, and regional variations, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the current epidemiological landscape and informing public health strategies.  

### Tools

- Python - Data cleaning and Exploratory data analysis
- MS PowerBI - Creating dashboards


### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting


### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the mpox africa dataset to answer key questions, such as:
1. Trend of confirmed cases for each country over the last 3years?
2. Trend of confirmed deaths for each country over the last 3 years?
3. What is the Case Fatality Ratio?
